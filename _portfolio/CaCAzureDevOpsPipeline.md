Are you in need of a Configuration-as-Code, cross-platform, expandable scaffold for continuously integrating your Microsoft 365 SaaS Configuration using a basic 'conditional' multi stage YAML pipeline for Azure Pipelines? You are in luck. This solution uses a pipeline with a manual Approval step, before deploying a release to TEST and again before releasing to PROD. This pipeline simply automates a connection to SharePoint Online and can than be expanded upon.
