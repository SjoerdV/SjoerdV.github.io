title: Moving the comments system for this blog to Mastodon

Since this blog is hosted on GitHub (as of yet...) and I am slowly detoxifying myself from American proprietary bigtech, I would like to embrace true decentralized, FOSS technologies and focus especially on the ActivityPub / Fediverse capabilities a bit more.

I have only considered this since:

* Discussions can now be free and not something to be controlled and/or archived by me (the blog owner). Ownership of a comment should belong to the actual owner.
* Discussions can also be held [**directly** on Mastodon][1], or [any other ActivityPub / Fediverse account][2] you might have. So you will not be required to trust a separate third party App (see below)

So, as of today (March 24rd 2025) comments to posts can be started on Mastodon.

## How will this work?

To be able to react to a blog post you are going to need a ActivityPub / Fediverse account. Since this is a technical blog, I will assume that almost all visitors will have such an account or know how to create it. If not please visit the links above. Mastodon is probably the easiest to onboard on, if you are just starting your Fediverse journey.

## Extra

I have pushed a single discussion 'placeholder' meant for all blog posts earlier than March 24rd 2025. Upcoming posts will receive an announcement on my Mastodon account as to enable commenting for all, by clicking the link (or copying it and pasting it in the search option of your Mastodon client App).

* Click the 'replying to this Mastodon post' link on each Post page to navigate directly to the Mastodon site in browser and post a reaction to the existing Toot placeholder.

## Wow, I want this as well!

The original comprehensive idea can be found [here][3]. But since my blog is still on GitHub Pages with the Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme, [this][4] blog was most helpful
