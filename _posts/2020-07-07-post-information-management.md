`Information Management` has gained even more weight in the cloud era, especially given the enormous range and variety of providers and services that can (may?) be used within the business context.

It was only about 10 years ago that all company data was usually stored on premises within a few well-organized systems, now it is probably the case that no one person within any organization is 100% sure 'where all digital assets are located/stored'. And even if a 'practical little Dropbox account' is not officially sanctioned by company policy, this does not offer any guarantee.

This phenomenon is also called '`ShadowIT`'.

Fortunately, such shady IT usage is no longer necessary because you can share files, emails, calls, chats and all kinds of ERP content quickly, safely, within business context with anyone. You can even work on it together through `#MicrosoftTeams`.

Having this technology does require you to think about facilitating some kind of 'channel' or 'provisioning flow' with which you can `#organize` those 'business' initiatives, keep an `#overview` and guarantee the `#safety` of use. As a bonus, such a channel prevents duplicate initiatives and content and allows you to maintain a `#clear` portfolio.

Check out this [LinkedIn post][1] if you require such a channel.
